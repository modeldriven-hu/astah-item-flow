# Astah Item Flow Plug-In

In SysML diagrams, accurately showing how items flow through connections is important. Adding an item flow using the toolbar is easy, but getting the points to match the connection pixel perfect can be tricky. The Astah Item Flow Plug-In solves this by helping you precisely adjust the item flow points to match the connection perfectly.

# How to Use
- Connect two ports in an Internal Block Diagram (IBD).
- Insert an Item Flow between those ports.
- Adjust the Item Flow coordinates as needed.
- Select the Item Flow.
- Go to 'Tools' -> 'SysML' -> 'Reset Item Flow Coordinates.' to align the points.

Following these steps ensures that your Item Flow points align accurately with the connection, creating a polished look in your SysML diagrams.
